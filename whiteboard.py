# Mumbling

# Write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with the characters
# in the original string repeated a number of times equal to their position in the string (1-indexed).
# and separated by a hyphen. The first instance of a unique character should be capitalized.


# Example:
# solution("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
# solution("Hello") -> "H-Ii Tttt-Hhhhhh-Eeeeee-Rrrrrrr-Eeeeeeee"

def solution(string):
    pass
